Library seems to be correct. It is organized well and comments are available where they are necessary. 
The library seems to have everything it needs, as it has the properties and the constructor. 
The only thing I would change is to make the percentComputerJbs to be a double instead of an integer, because a percentage is 
often times not a whole number.
